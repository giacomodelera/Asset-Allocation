# Asset Allocation

## Abstract
This study examines portfolio allocation strategies for the S&P500 index, which contains 11 sector indices and 5 factor indices. 

The analysis focuses on creating efficient portfolios using 2023 financial data through different techniques like the typical efficient frontier, constrained optimization, Black-Litterman model, and Principal Component Analysis. 

Portfolios are compared to an equally weighted benchmark using performance metrics such as risk, return, and diversification.
The in-sample analysis reveals the best allocations under various constraints, while the out-of-sample evaluation over 2024 analyzes the stability of these approaches. The results emphasize
the trade-offs between risk and return and the impact of constraints on portfolio diversification.
This study shows how portfolio theory is actually applied under dynamic market conditions.
